## _What is this?_
I've been playing around with Affinity Designer _(think Illustrator)_ in order to practice creating graphics and designing logos. What I wanted to do is implement a site that has a branding that I conceptualized from start to finish. The header logo is a simple text-path creation, and it utilizes SVG images and text to create scalable, aesthetically pleasing header font.

My goal for this project is to have a site that looks ready to be launched by a restaurant or food-supply chain, with professionalism written in how it performs on both desktop and mobile.
